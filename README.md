# SiufpGrades

Selenium Script to fetch grades from University Fernando Pessoa Grade website and notifies the user if there is any change.
This was created because the system did not have a notification system working and students had to login into the website each time to check for new grade publications.
It can be easily automated by a cronjob, and runs a headless browser so it can just run silently.
